Welcome to MindControl
======================

Introduction
------------

[MindControl][1] is a software tool that allows a researcher to utilize [optogenetics][2] to manipulate neural activity in a freely moving worm for behavioral neuroscience experiments. MindControl analyzes a video stream of a swimming nematode and in real time it generates an illumination pattern that targets specific neurons or cells within the worm. The software can output these patterns to a digital micrommirror device in a closed loop. In this way, a researcher can train arbitrary pulses of laser light only on specific cells or neurons of a worm as it moves. The software records detailed information about the worm's position, orientation and the state of the system for every frame of the video stream. This data is recorded in a human- and computer- readable YAML file. The software optionally also outputs raw and annotated video streams for later analysis. The [MindControl-analysis][3] software suite generates quantitative graphs and figures of nematode behavior based on the output from MindControl.

MindControl is the software component of [CoLBeRT] [4] (**Co**ntrolling **L**ocomotion and **Be**havior in **R**eal-**T**ime) as described in Leifer, A.M., Fang-Yen, C., Gershow, M., Alkema, M., Samuel, A.D.T., "Optogenetic manipulation of neural activity in freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans," Nature Methods, in press (2010).

Authors
-------

MindControl is written by Andrew Leifer with help from Marc Gershow. It is originally a  product of the [Samuel Lab][5] in the [Department of Physics][6] and the [Center for Brain Science][7] at [Harvard University][8]. Now it continues to be expanded and updated by Andrew Leifer at [his own lab][9] at the [Lewis-Sigler Institute][10] at [Princeton University] [11].

Compiling Your Own Binaries
---------------------------
To utilize camera or micromirror hardware functionality, you will need to compile the software from source. 

The code compiles under Windows 7 64 bit. At a minimum it requires:

*	`mingw-w64`
*	OpenCV 2
*	msys 1.0
*	`make`
*	`awk`

The calibration routines additionally requires:

*	`MATLAB`

Additionaly helper scripts require:

* Python 3x


To compile an executable that uses a camera and DLP requires

*	BitFlow framegrabber SDK
*	VIALUX ALP Basic DLP USB SDK

See the `makefile` for more details about the different compile targets.

An Important Note About Using This Code
=======================================
This code is primarily provided for the scientific record. Andrew Leifer does not have time to troubleshoot the installation of this software or to help with the modification of this software for your particular use.

If you want to compile this source code, please note that you will need to be proficient in the following core technologies and concepts:


* C and C++
* make and makefiles
* The GNU compiler, gcc and how to compile and link libraries
* the difference betwen statically linked and dynamically linked libraries
* using git and git submodules
* how to use the GNU toolchain on windows
* specifically how to use msys and mingw and how to use mingw-w64
* a thorough understanding of how to work with 32 bit and 64 bit binaries and libraries and how they cannot play together
* a thorough understanding of the differences between C and C++ and when and how they can be mixed and matched
* a working knowledge of standard windows libraries


Good luck!
