This file mostly contains the header files from the BitFlow SDK which is normally located at C:/BitFlow SDK 5.20/Include

It also has the crtdbg.h which is a santdard microsoft header file.

The header files here are all holdovers from the code as it was in Aravi's lab. 

That should have been BitFlow SDK5.2

The funny thing is that if I switch my include directory from here to C:/BitFlow SDK 5.20/Include things fail to compile.

I'm not going to deal with it now, but it is weird.
