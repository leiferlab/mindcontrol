This file mostly contains the header files from the BitFlow SDK which is normally located at C:/BitFlow SDK 5.60/Include

It also has the crtdbg.h which is a santdard microsoft header file.


NOTE: I have made slight changes to two files to get things to compile:
-  BFDef.h
-  BFTypeNT.h

In both cases any line of code that was changed is labeled with the comment //ANDY

In BFDef.h
I changed a typedef from DMAChannel to DMAChannelT. (Note I had to do this for the 5.2 SDK as well). 

In BFTypeNT.h I got rid of some #ifdef that checked to see if we are using Microsoft Visual C. This is a new one for 5.6.

If you look in the source code and search for "ANDY" it should all be clearly labeled.
